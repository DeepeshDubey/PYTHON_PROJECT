## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This script mimics the structure of a real-world news flash by randomly assembling three core components:

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Subject** | The entity (e.g., "TCS Developers", "PMO Office") |
| **Action**  | What the subject did (e.g., "released unstable update") |
| **Suffix**  | Result or outcome (e.g., "causing downtime in Asia") |

Each generated headline includes a **timestamp** to make it feel like a real breaking update.

ðŸ§­ User Interaction Flow 
The interaction with the script is fully terminal-based and user-friendly:

ðŸŸ¢ Step 1: Choose a Category
After starting the script, the user is prompted to select one of the following categories:

If an invalid option is entered:

ðŸŸ¢ Step 2: Enter the Number of Headlines
Next, the script asks how many headlines should be generated:


How many headlines do you want? 3
ðŸŸ¢ Step 3: Headline Generation Output
The script then prints the specified number of headlines like this:
